# Lunar Phase Art Visualization Project

This is a Python project that transforms lunar phase data into an artistic visualization. By analyzing lunar phase change data, it creates dynamic colored concentric circle patterns, where each ring represents the lunar phase state of a single day.

## Project Concept

Lunar phase changes are a fascinating natural phenomenon in astronomy. This project transforms them into visual art through the following approaches:
·Using colors to represent the lunar phase cycle (New Moon → Full Moon → New Moon)
· Using brightness to represent the dimming and brightening of lunar phases
· Using ring radius to represent the passage of time
· Adding lunar phase markers to display key phase states

## Features

· Automatically generates lunar phase data for a specified number of days
· Creates static visualization images
· Generates dynamic animations to showcase lunar phase changes
· Customizable color mapping and visual effects
